## ðŸ“Š Key Metrics (KPIs)
- **Total Quantity Sold:** 3,551 units  
- **Total Sales:** $45,134  
- **Top 10 Customers Contribution:** 8% of total sales  
- **Sales Distribution by Country:**  
  - United States: 79%  
  - United Kingdom: 15%

- **Orders by Coffee Type:** Fairly balanced, with Arabica (27%) leading slightly.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Key Insights
- Sales peaked in **2021** but dropped noticeably in **2022**
- **Arabica** and **Exclesa** generate the highest sales revenue, despite **Arabica** and **Robusta** being the most ordered coffee types, indicating a potential higher profit margin or pricing advantage for Exclesa.
- **United States dominates** sales (79%), suggesting an opportunity to grow market share in the UK and Ireland.
- **Top 10 customers contribute only 8%** of total sales, indicating a broad customer base rather than dependence on a few clients.

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations
1. **Boost Sales in 2022 and beyond**  
   Investigate the decline in 2022 sales and introduce marketing campaigns, promotions, or loyalty incentives.

2. **Expand Market Reach**  
   Invest in marketing strategies or localized promotions to grow sales in the **UK** and **Ireland**, where contributions are relatively low.

3. **Enhance Loyalty Programs**  
   While sales are spread across many customers, loyalty programs could turn occasional buyers into repeat customers.

4. **Boost Exclesa Sales with Pricing Analysis and Promotions**  
   Investigate **pricing** or **cost structures** to understand why **Exclesa** yields higher sales despite lower order volume, and consider targeted promotions to increase Exclesa orders while maintaining **Arabica** and **Robustaâ€™s** strong demand.
